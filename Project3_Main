For this project we will be using the Purchasingpower HouseholdCharacteristics dataset from CBS. \n
The dataset contains information about the purchasingpower of people whose household characteristics were the same as the year before. \n
For example if a person was the primary earner in a household during 2022 and 2023, the purchasingpower of this person is measured in the dataset. \n
The dataset consists of 10 columns: ID, HouseholdCharacteristics, Periods, MedianDevelopmentPurchasingPower, PersonsWithPurchasingPowerDecrease, PersonsWithPurchasingPowerIncrease, k_20thPercentile, k_40thPercentile, k_60thPercentile and k_80thPercentile. \n
The information about the HouseholdCharacteristics column is saved in a separate file: HouseholdCharacteristics.csv. The data is collected from 2012 until 2022.\n

Before we can start any analysis, we will have to import the dataset. For this we will use the pandas module.\n
After importing the dataset, we also added a header to give an impression of what the dataset looks like.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\alex0\\OneDrive\\Documenten\\Python Exercises\\UntypedDataSet.csv", sep=",")
df.head

For this analysis we want to compare the development of the median purchasingpower for couples that have children with couples that don't have children. \n
We thougth this would be an interesting comparison, because it is very expensive to raise children. Our expectation therefore is that couples that don't have children have developed a higher purchasingpower. \n
The ID that belongs to the household characteristics of couples with children is 1016090. For couples without children this ID is 1017780.\n
To compare the purchasingpower of these households, we will have to filter the dataset based on these IDs.


df_children = df[df["HouseholdCharacteristics"].isin(['1016090','1017780'])] #Filter the dataset so it only contains the data of couples with and without children

When the dataset is filtered, we can use the .plot function of the pandas library to create a barplot.\n
To build a barplot we also have to calculate the mean development of the purchasingpower over the total of years.


if df_children.empty:
    print("No rows match the filtering condition.") #If a problem occured during the filtering process, it will be shown here.
else:
    df_children.groupby("HouseholdCharacteristics")["MedianDevelopmentPurchasingPower_1"].mean().plot(kind="bar") #If no problem occured, the barplot will be constructed

In contrast to our expectations, the plot shows us that the average development of the purchasingpower in the last 10 years has been stronger for couples with children. \n
The average development of the purchasingpower for couples without children has even been slightly negative. \n
To give more insights into this data, we decided to construct graphs of the development of the purchasingpower for both types of households. \n
The graphs are shown below.

df_children2 = df[df["HouseholdCharacteristics"].isin(['1016090'])]
print(df_children2.head())

df_children2.plot(kind='line',x = "Periods", y = "MedianDevelopmentPurchasingPower_1")

df_children3 = df[df["HouseholdCharacteristics"].isin(['1017780'])]

df_children3.plot(kind = 'line', x = "Periods", y = "MedianDevelopmentPurchasingPower_1", color = "orange")

These graphs show that the development of purchasingpower for couples with children was mostly around 3-5% per year. \n
The development of purchasingpower for couples without children however was around 1% each year. \n
Lastly the graphs show us that for both types of households, the purchasingpower developed strongly negative around 2020. \n
This is likely because of the Covid-19 virus.


This analysis explores the median development purchasing power trends across different age categories, ranging from under 24 to 65 and older. \n 
Our objective is to investigate whether individuals in older age brackets exhibit higher purchasing power. \n
Each ID number varies in age category. \n 
A025340 is up to 24 years old. A025343 is 25 to 44 years old. A025351 is 44 to 64 years old. A025359 is 65 years and older.

df_main_earner = df[df["HouseholdCharacteristics"].isin(['A025340','A025343','A025351','A025359'])] # Filter the main earners of each age category

main_earner = df_main_earner['HouseholdCharacteristics']
values = df_main_earner['MedianDevelopmentPurchasingPower_1'] # Value of each median purchase power corresponding to their age category.
  
# Create the bar plot
plt.bar(main_earner, values)
plt.xlabel('Age Categories')
plt.ylabel('Median Purchase Power')
plt.show()

# Boxplot to check for outliers and IQR range
sns.boxplot(x='HouseholdCharacteristics', y='MedianDevelopmentPurchasingPower_1', data=df_main_earner)
plt.xlabel('Age Categories')
plt.ylabel('Median Purchase Power')
plt.show()

We use the plt. function to create a barplot and showcase each age category individually. The sns.boxplot function is used to create a visual for the potential outliers and IQR. \n
Based on this data we can conclude that the first age group has the highest median purchasing power. \n
The significance lies in the fact that each time we transition to an older age category, we can find a decrease in purchasing power, which goes against the initial claim. In this case, the youngest age category (A025340) has a significant higher purchase power.\n
The median purchase power for the youngest age group lies closer to the 75th percentile, suggesting a higher (general) purchase power value within that age category. \n
Lastly, the graphs show an increase in purchasing power throughout the years, especially around 2020-2021. However, the oldest age category has a slight decrease in purchase power.
