Median development purchasing power
Purchasing power is defined as the equivalised household income adjusted for price developments, which are based on the consumer price index (CPI). Purchasing power is used to determine income changes (in real terms), but may also be used to determine (developments in) differences in prosperity between individuals or households.

The development is measured by the median change in purchasing power. The median is defined as the value separating the higher half from the lower half. In simple terms, it may be thought of as the 'middle' value of a data set.
